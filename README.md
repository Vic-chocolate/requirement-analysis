What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

It is important due to the following reasons:
Requirement Analysis is crucial in the SDLC because it lays the foundation for all subsequent development, significantly reducing rework and costs by identifying issues early. It ensures all stakeholders are aligned on project goals, proactively mitigates risks, and provides the clear, testable criteria necessary for quality assurance. Ultimately, a thorough requirement analysis drives successful project delivery by ensuring the software meets user needs and business objectives efficiently.


Why is Requirement Analysis Important ?

1. Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
2. Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
3. Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
4. Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
5. Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
